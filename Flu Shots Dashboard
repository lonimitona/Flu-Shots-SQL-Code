/*
Objectives
Come up with flu shots dashboard for 2022 that does the following:

1. Total % of patients getting flu shots stratisfied by:
	a. Age
	b. Race
	c. County (On a map)
	d. Overall
2. Running total of flu shots over the course of 2022
3. Total number of flu shots given in 2022
4. A list of patients that show whether or not they received the flu shot

Requirements: Patients must have been active at our hospital.

--are not dead and have had encounters with the healthcare system in the past
--2 years and must be 6 months and older because people who are
--6 months and older are required to get flu shots every year
